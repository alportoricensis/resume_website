                    Hello World! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Alex Nunez-Carrasquillo, a Senior majoring in Computer Science and 
                    Minoring in Mathematics at The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Originally from Can√≥vanas, Puerto Rico, I spend my free time 
                    biking around the Border-to-Border trail, kayaking down the Huron River, building in Cities Skylines, tending to my houseplants, 
                    or growing crops in Stardew Valley. I visit my home occasionally, where I soak in the sea salt on the beach and visit my family. However, my 
                    true passion has always been computers, and anything related to them - from scripting in LUA on Roblox as a child, to pursuing a degree in 
                    Computer Science as an adult, I hope to one day apply my passion to help make people's quality of life better. My skills, experience, 
                    and passion would make me a perfect fit for your team!
                </p>
